## 🔬 The Innovation: SQL + AI

### Traditional Approach (Limited)

```sql
-- Only finds exact keywords
SELECT * FROM Complaints 
WHERE description LIKE '%water%';
```

**Problems:**
- Misses synonyms (pipeline, tap, supply)
- No context understanding
- Manual categorization needed

### Our AI-Enhanced Approach (Powerful)

```sql
-- Finds semantic meaning
SELECT *, 
       1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) AS score
FROM Complaints
WHERE ward = 'Ward 5'  -- Still use SQL filters!
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Understands meaning, not just words
- ✅ Finds "pipeline broken" when searching "water issue"
- ✅ Automatic relevance scoring
- ✅ Combines SQL power with AI intelligence

   - Restart PostgreSQL
   - Run `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`

2. **"Module not found"**
   - Activate virtual environment
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **"Connection refused"**
   - Check backend is running on port 8000
   - Check frontend is running on port 3000
   - Verify .env database credentials

4. **"Embeddings taking too long"**
   - First run downloads model (~80MB)
   - Subsequent runs are fast
   - Be patient during initial setup

For detailed troubleshooting, see **SETUP.md**
